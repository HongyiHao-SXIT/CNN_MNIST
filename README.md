# CS61B: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Descriptions

- Offered by: UC Berkeley
- Prerequisites: CS61A
- Programming Languages: Java
- Difficulty: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
- Class Hour: 60 hours

It is the second course of UC Berkeley's CS61 series. It mainly focuses on the design of data structures and algorithms as well as giving students the opportunity to be exposed to thousands of lines of engineering code and gain a preliminary understanding of software engineering through Java.

I took the version for 2018 Spring. Josh Hug, the instructor, generously made the autograder open-source. You can use [gradescope](https://gradescope.com/) invitation code published on the website for free and easily test your implementation.

All programming assignments in this course are done in Java. Students without Java experience don't have to worry. There will be detailed tutorials in the course from the configuration of IDEA to the core syntax and features of Java.

The quality of homework in this class is also unparalleled. The 14 labs will allow you to implement most of the data structures mentioned in the class by yourself, and the 10 homework will allow you to use data structures and algorithms to solve practical problems.
In addition, there are 3 projects that give you the opportunity to be exposed to thousands of lines of engineering code and enhance your Java skills in practice.

## Academic Integrity Notice
Academic integrity is of utmost importance in this course. You are expected to uphold the highest standards of honesty and ethical behavior in all your academic work. Plagiarism, cheating, and other forms of academic dishonesty are strictly prohibited.
Plagiarism: Do not copy someone else's work, including code, essays, or research, and present it as your own. All assignments and projects must be your original work. If you use external sources, make sure to properly cite them.
Cheating: Do not seek unauthorized assistance during exams or quizzes. This includes using notes, electronic devices, or communicating with others in an inappropriate way.
Collaboration: While some group work may be encouraged, make sure that you understand the boundaries of collaboration. Each student is responsible for their own learning and contribution to the group.
Violations of academic integrity will result in serious consequences, including but not limited to a failing grade for the assignment, course, or even disciplinary action from the university. By participating in this course, you agree to abide by the academic integrity policies of the institution.
